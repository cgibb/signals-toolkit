signals-toolkit
===============

UPDATE: Switching to Java. Mostly for making it easier for me to add a GUI later.
Basic DSP Toolkit made primarily to practice concepts learned in my courses.
For now it's in C for easy portability and better low-level practice than Octave
would provide. No promises on any actual pushes...
